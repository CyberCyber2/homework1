What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

In a merge we combine the changes from a branch into another whereas in a rebase we apply the changes on top of the other branch. Merging preserves the branch history. We should merge if others are working on different branches. A rebase would remove some of the commit history. Rebasing creates linear history in Git. In merges, we would see a non linear history showing the branches and merge commits.
